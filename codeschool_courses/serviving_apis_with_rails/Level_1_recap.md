#### Task 1: LIMITING RESOURCES
Our web API is exposing endpoints for the humans and weapons resources. Currently, all operations are allowed on these resources. However, if we want to make it through the Zombie Apocalypse, we need to be extremely careful about what operations we allow.

1. We cannot to allow the humans resources to be destroyed. Add the option that prevents that from happening.
2. We must limit the operations allowed on the weapons resources to `:index` and `:show`.

```ruby
# task code
# config/routes.rb
SurvivingRails::Application.routes.draw do
  resources :humans
  resources :weapons
end

# solution code
SurvivingRails::Application.routes.draw do
  resources :humans, except: :destroy
  resources :weapons, only: [:index, :show]
end
```

#### Task 2: RESTRICTING MULTIPLE ACTIONS
Weâ€™ve now changed our API to only allow listing resources for zombies, humans, medical_kits and broadcasts. Some unnecessary duplication is starting to smell, so now may be a good time to refactor our routes.

1. Refactor the current routes to use the `with_options` method. This method takes the options as the first argument and the resources definition as a block. Remember that the block takes one argument, which you will need to use in the resources definition.
2. Outside of the `with_options` block, create the messages resources and prohibit access to the destroy action.

```ruby
# task code
# config/routes.rb
SurvivingRails::Application.routes.draw do
  resources :zombies, only: :index
  resources :humans, only: :index
  resources :medical_kits, only: :index
  resources :broadcasts, only: :index
end

# solution code
SurvivingRails::Application.routes.draw do
	with_options only: :index do |list|
		list.resources :zombies
	  list.resources :humans
	  list.resources :medical_kits
	  list.resources :broadcasts
	end

  resources :messages, except: :destroy
end
```

#### Task 3: CONSTRAINTS AND NAMESPACES
Our codebase is serving both a web API and a web site. Therefore, it is very important that we keep our code extremely organized. This helps mitigate the risk of file conflicts, specially when multiple people work on the same project.

1. Use the namespace method to create a namespace for api, and move the zombies and humans resources into it.
2. Add a constraints option to our namespace and set its subdomain to api.
3. To avoid api being repeated on both the subdomain and on the URI path, add a path option to our namespace and set it to `/`.

```ruby
# task code
# config/routes.rb
SurvivingRails::Application.routes.draw do
  resources :announcements
  resources :zombies
  resources :humans
end

# solution code
SurvivingRails::Application.routes.draw do
	namespace :api, path: '/', constraints: { subdomain: 'api' } do
	  resources :zombies
	  resources :humans
	end

	resources :announcements
end
```
