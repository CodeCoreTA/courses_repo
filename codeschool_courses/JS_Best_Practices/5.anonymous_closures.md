#### Closure: Closure feature allow us to 'Privatize' properties
###### `Private` properties are `created` in the `local scope` of the `function expression`. `Public` properties are built within the `object` which is then `returned` to become the `namespace `. Access to `private` data is thus possible only because of `closure` within the larger `module`.

#### Task 1
###### Instead of using only a nested namespace create a CAVESOFCLARITY module
###### where the number of treasure chests is made private through anonymous closure."

```javascript
// Task code
var CAVESOFCLARITY = {
  stalactites: 4235,
  stalagmites: 3924,
  bats: 345,
  SECRET: {
    treasureChests: 3,
    openChest: function(){
      this.treasureChests--;
      alert("DA DADADA DAAAAAAA!");
    }
  }
};
```

#### IIFE : Immediately Invoked Function Call
```javascript
// Solution code
var CAVESOFCLARITY = (function(){
  var treasureChests = 3;
  return {
    stalactites: 4235,
    stalagmites: 3924,
    bats: 345,
    SECRET: {
      openChest: function(){
        treasureChests--;
        alert("DA DADADA DAAAAAAA!");
      }
    }
  };
})();
