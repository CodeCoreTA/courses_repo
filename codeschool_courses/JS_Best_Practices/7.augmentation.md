## Augmentation : Technique for adding or changing properties in a module after the module has already been built?

#### Task 1: Added additional functionality in `CAVESOFCLARITY` module with one piece of private data, and one public property that retrieves it.

```javascript
// Task Code
// cavesofclarity.js
var CAVESOFCLARITY = function () {

  var treasureChests = 3;
  var bats = 345;

  return {
    stalactites: 4235,
    stalagmites: 3924,
    SECRET: {
      openChest: function(){
        treasureChests--;
        alert("DA DADADA DAAAAAAA!");
      }
    }
  };
}();

// Solution Code
// extendCode.js
CAVESOFCLARITY = function (oldNS) {
  var sandScript = '';

  oldNS.setSandScript = function(message){
    sandScript = message;
  };
  return oldNS;
}(CAVESOFCLARITY);
```

**NOTE:**
* In simple `augmentation`, the `module` file and the augmentation file do not share their `private state`. 
* Augmented module `properties` may only `access` the `private` data from their file's `closure`. 
* `Private` data from the `original` closure will not be lost, and will be accessible to all original `properties` that referenced it.
